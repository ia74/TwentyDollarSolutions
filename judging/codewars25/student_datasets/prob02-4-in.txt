The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause She took him faster than you can say "Sabotage" I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it I underestimated just who I was dealing with She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum She underestimated just who she was stealing from She's not a saint and she's not what you think She's an actress, woah She's better known for the things that she does On the mattress, woah Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys On the playground won't make you many friends She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind There is nothing I do better than revenge
